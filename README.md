# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Projects

A collection of projects for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity.

## [Project 1: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/nhalflants/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree/tree/main/P1-sentiment-analysis)

Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model in AWS Sagemaker. In this project you construct a recurrent neural network in PyTorch trained to recognize the sentiment (positive or negative) of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you deploy your model and construct a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model. 

## [Project 2: Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/nhalflants/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree/tree/main/P2-plagiarism-detection)

Build and train a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text. 
Goal of this project is to clean and process data, extract meaningful features, and deploy a plagiarism classifier using SKLearn or PyTorch in SageMaker.

## [Project 3: Capstone Project]()

Coming soon
